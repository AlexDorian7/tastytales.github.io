A fork [TastyTales (and Co's) Vore Quiz](https://github.com/TastyTales/tastytales.github.io). I was bored one evening and was looking to learn how to use GitHub (fingers crossed that I'm doing everything right). 

Some things I've changed (in order of visibility):
- JS
	- Test framework should be more dynamic, allowing for different quiz sizes
	- Added a back button to let users go back to previous question
	- Commented and organized
	- Moved some text from JS to HTML
	- Ability to reset mid-quiz
- CSS
	- Redone aesthetic (to suit my tastes)
	- Gave the page a changeable "theme color"
	- Rules should be able to accommodate the addition/removal of buttons
	- Slightly commented
- HTML
	-  Made the site more modular; Compartmentalized major states into their own div menus

I'm pretty sure I forgot to do something else, but as it stands the test still works fine.
